	abstract = {The optic tectum is the largest visual center in most vertebrates and the main target for retinal ganglion cells ({RGCs}) conveying visual information from the eye to the brain. The retinotectal projection has served as an important model in many areas of developmental neuroscience. However, knowledge of the function of the tectum is limited. We began to address this issue using laser ablations and subsequent behavioral testing in zebrafish. We used a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses green-fluorescent protein in {RGCs} projecting to the tectum. By aiming a laser beam at the labeled retinal fibers demarcating the tectal neuropil, the larval tectum could be selectively destroyed. We tested whether tectum-ablated zebrafish larvae, when presented with large-field movements in their surroundings, displayed optokinetic responses ({OKR}) or optomotor responses ({OMR}), two distinct visuomotor behaviors that compensate for self-motion. Neither {OKR} nor {OMR} were found to be dependent on intact retinotectal connections. Also, visual acuity remained unaffected. Tectum ablation, however, slowed down the {OKR} by reducing the frequency of saccades but left tracking velocity, gain, and saccade amplitude unaffected. Removal of the tectum had no effect on the processing of second-order motion, to which zebrafish show both {OKR} and {OMR}, suggesting that the tectum is not an integral part of the circuit that extracts higher-order cues in the motion pathway.},

	abstract = {Most behaviors, even simple innate reflexes, are mediated by circuits of neurons spanning areas throughout the brain. However, in most cases, the distribution and dynamics of firing patterns of these neurons during behavior are not known. We imaged activity, with cellular resolution, throughout the whole brains of zebrafish performing the optokinetic response. We found a sparse, broadly distributed network that has an elaborate but ordered pattern, with a bilaterally symmetrical organization. Activity patterns fell into distinct clusters reflecting sensory and motor processing. By correlating neuronal responses with an array of sensory and motor variables, we find that the network can be clearly divided into distinct functional modules. Comparing aligned data from multiple fish, we find that the spatiotemporal activity dynamics and functional organization are highly stereotyped across individuals. These experiments systematically reveal the functional architecture of neural circuits underlying a sensorimotor behavior in a vertebrate brain.},

	abstract = {Animals continuously gather sensory cues to move towards favourable environments. Efficient goal-directed navigation requires sensory perception and motor commands to be intertwined in a feedback loop, yet the neural substrate underlying this sensorimotor task in the vertebrate brain remains elusive. Here, we combine virtual-reality behavioural assays, volumetric calcium imaging, optogenetic stimulation and circuit modelling to reveal the neural mechanisms through which a zebrafish performs phototaxis, i.e. actively orients towards a light source. Key to this process is a self-oscillating hindbrain population ({HBO}) that acts as a pacemaker for ocular saccades and controls the orientation of successive swim-bouts. It further integrates visual stimuli in a state-dependent manner, i.e. its response to visual inputs varies with the motor context, a mechanism that manifests itself in the phase-locked entrainment of the {HBO} by periodic stimuli. A rate model is developed that reproduces our observations and demonstrates how this sensorimotor processing eventually biases the animal trajectory towards bright regions.},

	abstract = {Latency between a user's movement and visual feedback is inevitable in every Virtual Reality application, as signal transmission and processing take time. Unfortunately, a high end-to-end latency impairs perception and motor performance. While it is possible to reduce feedback delay to tens of milliseconds, these delays will never completely vanish. Currently, there is a gap in literature regarding the impact of feedback delays on perception and motor performance as well as on their interplay in virtual environments employing full-body avatars. With the present study at hand, we address this gap by performing a systematic investigation of different levels of delay across a variety of perceptual and motor tasks during full-body action inside a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment. We presented participants with their virtual mirror image, which responded to their actions with feedback delays ranging from 45 to 350 ms. We measured the impact of these delays on motor performance, sense of agency, sense of body ownership and simultaneity perception by means of psychophysical procedures. Furthermore, we looked at interaction effects between these aspects to identify possible dependencies. The results show that motor performance and simultaneity perception are affected by latencies above 75 ms. Although sense of agency and body ownership only decline at a latency higher than 125 ms, and deteriorate for a latency greater than 300 ms, they do not break down completely even at the highest tested delay. Interestingly, participants perceptually infer the presence of delays more from their motor error in the task than from the actual level of delay. Whether or not participants notice a delay in a virtual environment might therefore depend on the motor task and their performance rather than on the actual delay.},

We focus on emerging light-sheet microscopy approaches, which are well suited for live imaging of large systems with high spatiotemporal resolution and over long periods of time.

	abstract = {The vestibular system, which reports on motion and gravity, is essential to postural control, balance, and egocentric representations of movement and space. The motion needed to stimulate the vestibular system complicates studying its circuitry, so we previously developed a method for ﬁctive vestibular stimulation in zebraﬁsh, using optical trapping to apply physical forces to the otoliths. Here, we combine this approach with whole-brain calcium imaging at cellular resolution, delivering a comprehensive map of the brain regions and cellular responses involved in basic vestibular processing. We ﬁnd responses broadly distributed across the brain, with unique proﬁles of cellular responses and topography in each region. The most widespread and abundant responses involve excitation that is graded to the stimulus strength. Other responses, localized to the telencephalon and habenulae, show excitation that is only weakly correlated to stimulus strength and that is sensitive to weak stimuli. Finally, numerous brain regions contain neurons that are inhibited by vestibular stimuli, and these neurons are often tightly localized spatially within their regions. By exerting separate control over the left and right otoliths, we explore the laterality of brain-wide vestibular processing, distinguishing between neurons with unilateral and bilateral vestibular sensitivity and revealing patterns whereby conﬂicting signals from the ears mutually cancel. Our results conﬁrm previously identiﬁed vestibular responses in speciﬁc regions of the larval zebraﬁsh brain while revealing a broader and more extensive network of vestibular responsive neurons than has previously been described. This provides a departure point for more targeted studies of the underlying functional circuits.},

To understand how and why coordination might emerge, we measured the kinematics of spontaneous vertical locomotion across early development in zebrafish (Danio rerio) . We found that zebrafish used their pectoral fins and bodies synergistically during upwards swims. As larvae developed, they changed the way they coordinated fin and body movements, allowing them to climb with increasingly stable postures. This fin-body synergy was absent in vestibular mutants, suggesting sensed imbalance promotes coordinated movements. Similarly, synergies were systematically altered following cerebellar lesions, identifying a neural substrate regulating fin-body coordination. Together these findings link the vestibular sense to the maturation of coordinated locomotion. Developing zebrafish improve postural stability by changing fin-body coordination. We therefore propose that the development of coordinated locomotion is regulated by vestibular sensation.},

	abstract = {The zebrafish provides an important model for vertebrate inner ear development. The otic placode becomes visible at ∼16 hours (at 28.5°C) and forms a vesicle with a lumen by cavitation at ∼18 hours. Two otoliths appear in the lumen by 19.5 hours, and at about 24 hours the first sensory hair cells are seen, grouped in two small patches, one beneath each otolith, corresponding to future maculae. Staining with fluorescent phalloidin reveals 10–20 hair cells in each macula by 42 hours; between 3 days and 7 days the numbers grow to ∼80 per macula. Neurons of the statoacoustic ganglion are first visible by staining with {HNK}-1 antibody at about 24 hours. Serial sections and time-lapse films show that the neuronal precursors originate by delamination from the ventral face of the otocyst; the peak period of delamination is from 22 hours to 30 hours. The system of semicircular canals forms between 42 hours and 72 hours by outgrowth of protrusions from the walls of the otocyst to form pillars of tissue spanning the lumen. Three further clusters of hair cells also become visible in this period, forming the three cristae. Thus, by the end of the first week, all key components of the ear are present. Subsequent growth produces thousands more hair cells; additional neurons probably derive from proliferation of neuronal precursors within the ganglion. Although the timetable is species-specific, the principles of inner ear development in the zebrafish seem to be the same as in other vertebrates. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The retina of a larva encodes behaviorally relevant visual information in neural activity distributed across feature-selective ganglion cells such that signals representing distinct stimulus properties arrive in different areas or layers of the brain. Motor centers in the hindbrain encode motor variables that are precisely tuned to behavioral needs within a given stimulus setting. Owing to rapid technological progress, larval zebrafish provide unique opportunities for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the intermediate processing steps occurring between visual and motor centers, revealing how visuomotor transformations are implemented in a vertebrate brain.},

For example, when performed with visible excitation light, functional imaging can disrupt the day/night cycle due to the induced visual stimulation. To address this issue, we developed a custom-made two-photon light-sheet microscope optimized for high-speed volumetric imaging. By employing infra-red light (not visible to the larva) for excitation, we are able to record wholebrain neuronal activity with high temporal- and spatial-resolution without affecting the sleep state. In two-photon light-sheet microscopy the maximum achievable frame rate is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. To maximize this parameter, we optimized our setup for high peak power of excitation light, while finely controlling its polarisation, and we implemented remote scanning of the focal plane to record without disturbing the sample. Using this setup, as a preliminary result, we characterized the intensity spectra of neuronal calcium traces of 4 days post fertilisation larvae during the day/night phases. We aim to extend these results to multiple brain regions and frequency bands.},

Fluctuating states such as alertness can be governed by neuromodulation, but the underlying mechanisms and cell types involved are not fully understood. We developed a method to globally screen for cell types involved in behavior by integrating brain-wide activity imaging with high-content molecular phenotyping and volume registration at cellular resolution. We used this method ({MultiMAP}) to record from 22 neuromodulatory cell types in behaving zebrafish during a reaction-time task that reports alertness. We identified multiple monoaminergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic cell types linked to alertness and found that activity in these cell types was mutually correlated during heightened alertness. We next recorded from and controlled homologous neuromodulatory cells in mice; alertness-related cell-type dynamics exhibited striking evolutionary conservation and modulated behavior similarly. These experiments establish a method for unbiased discovery of cellular elements underlying behavior and reveal an evolutionarily conserved set of diverse neuromodulatory systems that collectively govern internal state.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For many years the effects of calcium on neuronal signaling were explained only in terms of calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels and biophysical charge screening. More recently however, it has been recognized that the calcium-sensing receptor is prevalent in the nervous system and regulates synaptic transmission and neuronal activity via multiple signaling pathways. Here we review the multiplicity of mechanisms by which changes in extracellular calcium alter neuronal signaling and propose that multiple mechanisms are required to describe the full range of experimental observations.},

	abstract = {Summary The vestibular apparatus provides animals with postural and movement-related information that is essential to adequately execute numerous sensorimotor tasks. In order to activate this sensory system in a physiological manner, one needs to macroscopically rotate or translate the animal’s head, which in turn renders simultaneous neural recordings highly challenging. Here we report on a novel miniaturized, light-sheet microscope that can be dynamically co-rotated with a head-restrained zebrafish larva, enabling controlled vestibular stimulation. The mechanical rigidity of the microscope allows one to perform whole-brain functional imaging with state-of-the-art resolution and signal-to-noise ratio while imposing up to 25° in angular position and 6,000°/s2 in rotational acceleration. We illustrate the potential of this novel setup by producing the first whole-brain response maps to sinusoidal and stepwise vestibular stimulation. The responsive population spans multiple brain areas and displays bilateral symmetry, and its organization is highly stereotypic across individuals. Using Fourier and regression analysis, we identified three major functional clusters that exhibit well-defined phasic and tonic response patterns to vestibular stimulation. Our rotatable light-sheet microscope provides a unique tool for systematically studying vestibular processing in the vertebrate brain and extends the potential of virtual-reality systems to explore complex multisensory and motor integration during simulated 3D navigation.},

Two-photon fiberscopes have been developed with the aim of enabling high-resolution imaging of neural activity in freely behaving animals. They use fiber optics to deliver laser light for two-photon excitation. Their small front piece typically contains a miniature scanning mechanism and imaging optics. Two-photon fiberscopes can be made sufficiently small and lightweight to be carried by rats and mice and to allow virtually unrestricted movement within a behavioral arena. Typically mounted to the animal’s skull above a cranial window, two-photon fiberscopes permit imaging of cells down to at least 250 µm below the brain surface (e.g., in rat neocortex). In freely exploring animals, action-potential-evoked calcium transients can be imaged in individual somata of visual cortex neurons bulk-labeled with a calcium indicator. Two-photon fiberscopes thus enable high-resolution optical recording of neural activity with cellular resolution during natural behaviors.},

These fibers have been recently proposed as low loss, broadband {THz} waveguides. By starting from a description in terms of coupling between air and dielectric modes in a single tube waveguide, a simple and useful model is proposed and numerically validated. It is able to predict dispersion curves, high and low loss spectral regions, and the conditions to ensure the existence of low loss regions. In addition, it allows a better understanding of the role of the geometrical parameters and of the dielectric refractive index. The model is then applied to improve the tradeoff between low loss and effectively single mode propagation, showing that the best results are obtained with a heptagonal arrangement of the tubes.},

However, limitations posed by scattering and absorption prohibit non-invasive multi-photon approaches for deep ({\textgreater}2mm) structures, while gradient refractive index ({GRIN}) endoscopes are relatively thick and can cause significant damage upon insertion. Here, we present a novel micro-endoscope design to image neural activity at arbitrary depths via an ultra-thin multi-mode optical fiber ({MMF}) probe that has 5–10X thinner diameter than commercially available micro-endoscopes. We demonstrate micron-scale resolution, multi-spectral and volumetric imaging. In contrast to previous approaches, we show that this method has an improved acquisition speed that is sufficient to capture rapid neuronal dynamics in-vivo in rodents expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator ({GCaMP}). Our results emphasize the potential of this technology in neuroscience applications and open up possibilities for cellular resolution imaging in previously unreachable brain regions.},

Neurons expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator {GCaMP}3 were imaged through a chronic hippocampal window. Head-fixed mice performed spatial behaviors within a setup combining a virtual reality system and a custom built two-photon microscope. Populations of place cells were optically identified, and the correlation between the location of their place fields in the virtual environment and their anatomical location in the local circuit was measured. The combination of virtual reality and high-resolution functional imaging should allow for a new generation of studies to probe neuronal circuit dynamics during behavior.},

Our measurements of physiological responses and tissue-damage thresholds define pulse parameters and safety limits for damage-free three-photon imaging. We image functional visual responses of neurons expressing {GCaMP}6s across all layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) and in the subplate. These recordings reveal diverse visual selectivity in deep layers: layer 5 neurons are more broadly tuned to visual stimuli, whereas mean orientation selectivity of layer 6 neurons is slightly sharper, compared to neurons in other layers. Subplate neurons, located in the white matter below cortical layer 6 and characterized here for the first time, show low visual responsivity and broad orientation selectivity.},

	abstract = {Coherent Raman scattering microscopy is a fast, label-free, and chemically specific imaging technique that shows high potential for future in vivo optical histology. However, the imaging depth in tissues is limited to the sub-millimeter range because of absorption and scattering. Realization of coherent Raman imaging using a fiber endoscope system is a crucial step towards imaging deep inside living tissues and providing information that is inaccessible with current microscopy tools. Until now, the development of coherent Raman endoscopy has been hampered by several issues, mainly related to the fiber delivery of the excitation pulses and signal collection. Here, we present a flexible, compact, coherent Raman, and multimodal nonlinear endoscope (4.2 mm outer diameter, 71 mm rigid length) based on a resonantly scanned hollow-core Kagomé-lattice double-clad fiber. The fiber design enables distortion-less, background-free delivery of femtosecond excitation pulses and back-collection of nonlinear signals through the same fiber. Sub-micrometer spatial resolution over a large field of view is obtained by combination of a miniature objective lens with a silica microsphere lens inserted into the fiber core. We demonstrate high-resolution, high-contrast coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, and second harmonic generation endoscopic imaging of biological tissues over a field of view of 320 µm at a rate of 0.8 frames per second. These results pave the way for intraoperative label-free imaging applied to real-time histopathology diagnosis and surgery guidance.},

An ongoing challenge is to achieve minimally invasive and high-resolution observations of neuronal activity in vivo inside deep brain areas. Recently introduced methods for holographic control of light propagation in complex media enable the use of a hair-thin multimode optical ﬁbre as an ultranarrow imaging tool. Compared to endoscopes based on graded-index lenses or ﬁbre bundles, this new approach offers a footprint reduction exceeding an order of magnitude, combined with a signiﬁcant enhancement in resolution. We designed a compact and high-speed system for ﬂuorescent imaging at the tip of a ﬁbre, achieving a resolution of 1.18 ± 0.04 µm across a 50-µm ﬁeld of view, yielding 7-kilopixel images at a rate of 3.5 frames/s. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vivo observations of cell bodies and processes of inhibitory neurons within deep layers of the visual cortex and hippocampus of anaesthetised mice. This study paves the way for modern microscopy to be applied deep inside tissues of living animal models while exerting a minimal impact on their structural and functional properties.},

However, mode phase-velocity dispersion and random mode coupling change with bending, temperature, and other perturbations, producing scrambling interference among propagating modes; hence preventing its use for focusing or imaging. To tackle this problem we introduce a system capable of re-focusing light through a multimode fiber in 37ms, one order of magnitude faster than demonstrated in previous reports. As a result, the focus spot can be maintained during significant bending of the fiber, opening numerous opportunities for endoscopic imaging and energy delivery applications. We measure the transmission matrix of the fiber by projecting binary-amplitude computer generated holograms using a digital micro-mirror device controlled by a field programmable gate array. The system shows two orders of magnitude enhancements of the focus spot relative to the background.},

Doublet achromatic lenses and a double cladding fiber with a high inner cladding numerical aperture are found to produce a high signal collection efficiency, which is essential for imaging live tissues.

Light-sheet microscopy is ideal for such samples as it records high-contrast images of entire planes within large samples at once. However, in order to obtain images of different planes, it has been necessary to move the sample relative to the fixed focal plane of the detection objective lens. This mechanical movement limits speed, precision and may be harmful to the sample. We have built a light-sheet microscope that uses remote focusing with an electrically tunable lens ({ETL}). Without moving specimen or objective we have thereby achieved flexible volume imaging at much higher speeds than previously reported. Our high-speed microscope delivers 3D snapshots of sensitive biological samples. As an example, we imaged 17 planes within a beating zebrafish heart at 510 frames per second, equivalent to 30 volume scans per second. Movements, shape changes and signals across the entire volume can be followed which has been impossible with existing reconstruction techniques.},

	abstract = {Recent progress with optogenetic probes for imaging and manipulating neural activity has further increased the relevance of fiber-optic systems for neural circuitry research. Optical fibers, which bi-directionally transmit light between separate sites (even at a distance of several meters), can be used for either optical imaging or manipulating neural activity relevant to behavioral circuitry mechanisms. The method's flexibility and the specifications of the light structure are well suited for following the behavior of freely moving animals. Furthermore, thin optical fibers allow researchers to monitor neural activity from not only the cortical surface but also deep brain regions, including the hippocampus and amygdala. Such regions are difficult to target with two-photon microscopes. Optogenetic manipulation of neural activity with an optical fiber has the advantage of being selective for both cell-types and projections as compared to conventional electrophysiological brain tissue stimulation. It is difficult to extract any data regarding changes in neural activity solely from a fiber-optic manipulation device; however, the readout of data is made possible by combining manipulation with electrophysiological recording, or the simultaneous application of optical imaging and manipulation using a bundle-fiber. The present review introduces recent progress in fiber-optic imaging and manipulation methods, while also discussing fiber-optic system designs that are suitable for a given experimental protocol.},

It is shown that {HC} {MOFs} with the cladding consisting only of one row of silica capillaries allows to guide light from the near to mid infrared despite of high material losses of silica in this spectral region. Such result can be obtained by a special arrangement of cladding capillaries which leads to a change in the sign of the core boundary curvature. The change in the sign of the core boundary curvature leads to a loss of simplicity of boundary conditions for core modes and to “localization” and limitation of their interaction with the cladding material in space. Such {HC} {MOFs} made of different materials can be potential candidates for solving problem of ultra high power transmission including transmission of {CO} and {CO}2 laser radiation.},

Its cladding is composed of a circular arrangement of dielectric tubes surrounded by a heat-shrink jacket that allows the fiber to be flexible. Characterization of straight samples shows that the hollow core allows the absorption caused by the polymethylmethacrylate tubes of the cladding to be reduced by 31 times at 0.375 {THz} and 272 times at 0.828 {THz} with respect to the bulk material, achieving losses of 0.3 and 0.16 {dB}/cm respectively. Bending loss is also experimentally measured and compared to numerical results. For large bending radii bending loss scales as Rb−2, whereas for small bending radii additional resonances between core and cladding appear. The transmission window bandwidth is also shown to shrink as the bending radius is reduced. An analytical model is proposed to predict and quantify both of these bending effects.},

	abstract = {According to Einstein’s equivalence principle, inertial accelerations during translational motion are physically indistinguishable from gravitational accelerations experienced during tilting movements. Nevertheless, despite ambiguous sensory representation of motion in primary otolith afferents, primate oculomotor responses are appropriately compensatory for the correct translational component of the head movement. The neural computational strategies used by the brain to discriminate the two and to reliably detect translational motion were investigated in the primate vestibulo-ocular system. The experimental protocols consisted of either lateral translations, roll tilts, or combined translation–tilt paradigms. Results using both steady-state sinusoidal and transient motion profiles in darkness or near target viewing demonstrated that semicircular canal signals are necessary sensory cues for the discrimination between different sources of linear acceleration. When the semicircular canals were inactivated, horizontal eye movements (appropriate for translational motion) could no longer be correlated with head translation. Instead, translational eye movements totally reflected the erroneous primary otolith afferent signals and were correlated with the resultant acceleration, regardless of whether it resulted from translation or tilt. Therefore, at least for frequencies in which the vestibulo-ocular reflex is important for gaze stabilization ({\textgreater}0.1 Hz), the oculomotor system discriminates between head translation and tilt primarily by sensory integration mechanisms rather than frequency segregation of otolith afferent information. Nonlinear neural computational schemes are proposed in which not only linear acceleration information from the otolith receptors but also angular velocity signals from the semicircular canals are simultaneously used by the brain to correctly estimate the source of linear acceleration and to elicit appropriate oculomotor responses.},

	abstract = {A gaze-stabilization reflex that has been conserved throughout evolution is the rotational vestibuloocular reflex ({RVOR}), which keeps images stable on the entire retina during head rotation. An ethological newer reflex, the translational or linear {VOR} ({TVOR}), provides fast foveal image stabilization during linear motion. Whereas the sensorimotor processing has been extensively studied in the {RVOR}, much less is currently known about the neural organization of the {TVOR}. Here we summarize the computational problems faced by the system and the potential solutions that might be used by brain stem and cerebellar neurons participating in the {VORs}. First and foremost, recent experimental and theoretical evidence has shown that, contrary to popular beliefs, the sensory signals driving the {TVOR} arise from both the otolith organs and the semicircular canals. Additional unresolved issues include a scaling by both eye position and vergence angle as well as the temporal transformation of linear acceleration signals into eye-position commands. Behavioral differences between the {RVOR} and {TVOR}, as well as distinct differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological properties, raise multiple functional questions and computational issues, only some of which are readily understood. In this review, we provide a summary of what is known about the functional properties and neural substrates for this oculomotor system and outline some specific hypotheses about how sensory information is centrally processed to create motor commands for the {VORs}.},

Without external feedback, ‘‘unsupervised’’ multisensory calibration reduces cue conﬂict in a manner largely independent of cue reliability. But environmental feedback regarding cue accuracy (‘‘supervised’’) also affects calibration. Here we measured the combined inﬂuence of cue accuracy and cue reliability on supervised multisensory calibration, using discrepant visual and vestibular motion stimuli. When the less reliable cue was inaccurate, it alone got calibrated. However, when the more reliable cue was inaccurate, cues were yoked and calibrated together in the same direction. Strikingly, the less reliable cue shifted away from external feedback, becoming less accurate. A computational model in which supervised and unsupervised calibration work in parallel, where the former only relies on the multisensory percept, but the latter can calibrate cues individually, accounts for the observed behavior. In combination, they could ultimately achieve the optimal solution of both external accuracy and internal consistency.},

Recent work in a genetically and optically accessible vertebrate, the larval zebrafish, has begun to reveal the mechanisms by which such vestibular behaviors and circuits come to function. Here we highlight recent work that leverages the particular advantages of the larval zebrafish to illuminate mechanisms of postural development, the role of sensation for balance circuit development, and the organization of developing vestibular circuits.

Two new classes of photonic crystal fiber facilitate ultrashort pulse delivery for fiber-optic two-photon fluorescence imaging. An upcoming generation of fluorescence imaging devices will be based on microfabricated device components.},

	abstract = {Most current self-sovereign identity systems may be categorized as strictly objective, consisting of cryptographically signed statements issued by trusted third party attestors. This failure to provide an input for subjectivity accounts for a central challenge: the inability to address the question of "Who verifies the verifier?". Instead, these protocols outsource their legitimacy to mechanisms beyond their internal structure, relying on traditional centralized institutions such as national {ID} issuers and {KYC} providers to verify the claims they hold. This reliance has been employed to safeguard applications from a vulnerability previously thought to be impossible to address in distributed systems: the Sybil attack problem, which describes the abuse of an online system by creating many illegitimate virtual personas. Inspired by the progress in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there has recently been a surge in networked protocols that make use of subjective inputs such as voting, vouching, and interpreting, to arrive at a decentralized and sybil-resistant consensus for identity. In this article, we will outline the approaches of these new and natively digital sources of authentication -- their attributes, methodologies strengths, and weaknesses -- and sketch out possible directions for future developments.},

This social network is a key piece of this cryptocurrency, which therefore puts much effort in ensuring that nodes correspond to unique, well identified, real living human users, linked together only if they met at least once in real world. Using this data, we study how social ties impact the structure of transactions and conversely. We show that users make transactions almost exclusively with people they are connected with in the social network. Instead, they tend to build social connections with people they will never make transactions with.},

	abstract = {Since the 2008 financial crisis, the number of alternative currencies aiming at transforming global financial institutions, such as local and complementary currencies ({LCC}) and cryptocurrencies, has exploded. Yet the motivations and workings of such monies are relatively unknown. This chapter aims to fill this gap by providing a framework that uncovers the ideals pursued by alternative currencies, and the effects of those ideals on the production of money. To do so, I present a comparative analysis of the valuation infrastructure – the processes through which value(s) is produced – of one {LCC}, Sol Violette, and three cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ğ1 “June” and impak Coin. Throughout, I elaborate on the social meaning of money and the role played by alternative currencies in contemporary capitalism. I show that 1) despite targeting the same financial institutions, the utopia pursued by alternative currencies varies significantly and 2) this utopia is at least as important as the technology (e.g. blockchain) in shaping the workings of these monies. Based on these findings, I outline some implications for the social studies of financial technologies, their effects on our societies and their regulation.},

	abstract = {We have been studying the consequences of embryonic vestibular dysfunction caused by the monolith (mnl) mutation in zebrafish. mnl is a dominant mutation that specifically inhibits formation of utricular otoliths. However, briefly immobilizing mnl/mnl embryos in agarose with the otic vesicle orientated at certain angles selectively induces or prevents formation of utricular and/or saccular otoliths. With this noninvasive technique, we generated six phenotypic classes of mnl/mnl mutants, designated S-S, U-U, U-S, S-{US}, U-{US}, and {US}-{US}, depending on which otoliths are present on each side (U, utricular otolith; S, saccular otolith). All mnl/mnl larvae survived through day 10 of development. Thereafter, S-S larvae showed a rapid decline, probably because of starvation, and none survived to adulthood. Survival rates in all other classes of mnl/mnl larvae (those having at least one utricular otolith) were close to normal. The presence or absence of utricular otoliths also correlated with vestibular function during early larval development, as measured by three criteria: First, unlike wild-type larvae, S-S mutant larvae showed almost no detectable counter-rotation of the eyes when tilted tail up or tail down. Second, 95\\% of S-S mutant larvae never acquired the ability to maintain a balanced dorsal-up posture. Third, although most wild-type larvae responded to gentle prodding by swimming in a straight line, S-S larvae responded by swimming in rapid circles, showing sudden and frequent changes in direction (“zigzagging”), and/or rolling and spiraling. All other phenotypic classes of mnl/mnl larvae behaved normally in these assays. These data demonstrate that bilateral loss of utricular otoliths disrupts the ability to sense gravity, severely impairs balance and motor coordination, and is invariably lethal. The presence of a utricular otolith in at least one inner ear is necessary and sufficient for vestibular function and survival. In contrast, saccular otoliths are dispensable for these functions. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. J Neurobiol 43: 329–337, 2000},

The glial cells outnumber the neurones and the two cell types occupy a comparable amount of space in nervous tissue. The main glial cell types are, in the central nervous system, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and, in the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells, enteric glial cells and satellite cells. In the embryo, glial cells form a cellular framework that permits the development of the rest of the nervous system, and regulate neuronal survival and differentiation. The best known function of glia in the adult is the formation of myelin sheaths around axons thus allowing the fast conduction of signalling essential for nervous system function. Glia also maintain appropriate concentrations of ions and neurotransmitters in the neuronal environment. Increasing body of evidence indicates that glial cells are essential regulators of the formation, maintenance and function of synapses, the key functional unit of the nervous system.},

This Ca2+ signal is controlled by an interplay of different mechanisms including plasmalemmal and intracellular Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ transporters and cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffers. In astrocytes, the Ca2+ signal can travel as waves within the syncytium spreading via gap junctions which might be regarded as a possible means for interglial communication. Ca2+ signalling is also an important medium for neurone-glia interaction: neuronal activity can trigger Ca2+ signals in glial cells and, in turn, there is evidence that glial Ca2+ signals can elicit responses in neurones. While glial cells are not equipped with the proper channels to generate action potentials, Ca2+ signalling could be the instrument by which these cells integrate and propagate signals in the {CNS}.

The role of glial cells in synapse formation and function was studied in cultures of purified neurons from the rat central nervous system. In glia-free cultures, retinal ganglion cells formed synapses with normal ultrastructure but displayed little spontaneous synaptic activity and high failure rates in evoked synaptic transmission. In cocultures with neuroglia, the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents were potentiated by 70-fold and 5-fold, respectively, and fewer transmission failures occurred. Glial cells increased the action potential–independent quantal release by 12-fold without affecting neuronal survival. Thus, developing neurons in culture form inefficient synapses that require glial signals to become fully functional.},

The fusion can be numerically adjusted, using a single parameter, to produce optically sectioned images of varying thicknesses with the same raw data. Direct comparison between our {HiLo} microscope and a commercial confocal laser scanning microscope is made on the basis of sectioning strength and imaging performance. Specifically, we show that {HiLo} and confocal 3-D imaging of a {GFP}-labeled mouse brain hippocampus are comparable in quality. Moreover, {HiLo} microscopy is capable of faster, near video rate imaging over larger fields of view than attainable with standard confocal microscopes.

Demonstrating how this technique can be used to reveal functionally defined circuits across the brain, we identify two populations of neurons with correlated activity patterns. One circuit consists of hindbrain neurons functionally coupled to spinal cord neuropil. The other consists of an anatomically symmetric population in the anterior hindbrain, with activity in the left and right halves oscillating in antiphase, on a timescale of 20 s, and coupled to equally slow oscillations in the inferior olive.},

Unlike other senses, vestibular information in the central nervous system becomes immediately multisensory and multimodal. There is no overt, readily recognizable conscious sensation from these organs, yet vestibular signals contribute to a surprising range of brain functions, from the most automatic reﬂexes to spatial perception and motor coordination. Critical to these diverse, multimodal functions are multiple computationally intriguing levels of processing. For example, the need for multisensory integration necessitates vestibular representations in multiple reference frames. Proprioceptive-vestibular interactions, coupled with corollary discharge of a motor plan, allow the brain to distinguish actively generated from passive head movements. Finally, nonlinear interactions between otolith and canal signals allow the vestibular system to function as an inertial sensor and contribute critically to both navigation and spatial orientation.},

	abstract = {Historically, the study of multisensory processing has examined the function of the definitive neuron type, the bimodal neuron. These neurons are excited by inputs from more than one sensory modality, and when multisensory stimuli are present, they can integrate their responses in a predictable manner. However, recent studies have revealed that multisensory processing in the cortex is not restricted to bimodal neurons. The present investigation sought to examine the potential for multisensory processing in nonbimodal (unimodal) neurons in the retinotopically organized posterolateral lateral suprasylvian ({PLLS}) area of the cat. Standard extracellular recordings were used to measure responses of all neurons encountered to both separate- and combined-modality stimulation. Whereas bimodal neurons behaved as predicted, the surprising result was that 16\\% of unimodal visual neurons encountered were significantly facilitated by auditory stimuli. Because these unimodal visual neurons did not respond to an auditory stimulus presented alone but had their visual responses modulated by concurrent auditory stimulation, they represent a new form of multisensory neuron: the subthreshold multisensory neuron. These data also demonstrate that bimodal neurons can no longer be regarded as the exclusive basis for multisensory processing.},

	abstract = {Inferences drawn from functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies are dependent on the statistical criteria used to define different brain regions as “active” or “inactive” under the experimental manipulation. In {fMRI} studies of multisensory integration, additional criteria are used to classify a subset of the active brain regions as “multisensory.” Because there is no general agreement in the literature on the optimal criteria for performing this classification, we investigated the effects of seven different multisensory stat-istical criteria on a single test dataset collected as human subjects performed auditory, visual, and auditory– visual object recognition. Activation maps created using the different criteria differed dramatically. The classification of the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}) was used as a performance measure, because a large body of converging evidence demonstrates that the {STS} is important for auditory–visual integration. Acommonly proposed criterion, “supra-additivity” or “super-additivity”, which requires the multisensory response to be larger than the summed unisensory responses, did not classify {STS} as multisensory. Alternative criteria, such as requiring the multisensory response to be larger than the maximum or the mean of the unisensory responses, successfully classified {STS} as multisensory. This practical demonstration strengthens theoretical arguments that the super-additivity is not an appropriate criterion for all studies of multisensory integration. Moreover, the importance of examining evoked {fMRI} responses, whole brain activation maps, maps from multiple individual subjects, and mixed-effect group maps are discussed in the context of selecting statistical criteria.},

	abstract = {The ventriloquist creates the illusion that his or her voice emerges from the visibly moving mouth of the puppet [1]. This well-known illusion exemplifies a basic principle of how auditory and visual information is integrated in the brain to form a unified multimodal percept. When auditory and visual stimuli occur simultaneously at different locations, the more spatially precise visual information dominates the perceived location of the multimodal event. Previous studies have examined neural interactions between spatially disparate auditory and visual stimuli 2, 3, 4, 5, but none has found evidence for a visual influence on the auditory cortex that could be directly linked to the illusion of a shifted auditory percept. Here we utilized event-related brain potentials combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate on a trial-by-trial basis that a precisely timed biasing of the left-right balance of auditory cortex activity by the discrepant visual input underlies the ventriloquist illusion. This cortical biasing may reflect a fundamental mechanism for integrating the auditory and visual components of environmental events, which ensures that the sounds are adaptively localized to the more reliable position provided by the visual input.},

	abstract = {A central tenet in brain research is that early sensory cortex is modality specific, and, only in exceptional cases, such as deaf and blind subjects or professional musicians, is influenced by other modalities. Here we describe extensive cross-modal activation in the auditory cortex of two monkeys while they performed a demanding auditory categorization task: after a cue light was turned on, monkeys could initiate a tone sequence by touching a bar and then earn a reward by releasing the bar on occurrence of a falling frequency contour in the sequence. In their primary auditory cortex and posterior belt areas, we found many acoustically responsive neurons whose firing was synchronized to the cue light or to the touch or release of the bar. Of 315 multiunits, 45 exhibited cue light-related firing, 194 exhibited firing that was related to bar touch, and 268 exhibited firing that was related to bar release. Among 60 single units, we found one neuron with cue light-related firing, 21 with bar touch-related firing, and 36 with release-related firing. This firing disappeared at individual sites when the monkeys performed a visual detection task. Our findings corroborate and extend recent findings on cross-modal activation in the auditory cortex and suggests that the auditory cortex can be activated by visual and somatosensory stimulation and by movements. We speculate that the multimodal corepresentation in the auditory cortex has arisen from the intensive practice of the subjects with the behavioral procedure and that it facilitates the performance of audiomotor tasks in proficient subjects.},

Damage to a region of the brain in the left basal posterior temporal lobe ({BA}37), which is strategically situated between the visual cortex and the more anterior temporal cortex, leads to reading and naming deficits1,2. Additional evidence implicating this region in linguistic processing comes from functional neuroimaging studies of reading in normal subjects3,4,5,6,7 and subjects with developmental dyslexia8,9. Here we test whether the visual component of reading is essential for activation of {BA}37 by comparing cortical activations elicited by word processing in congenitally blind, late-blind and sighted subjects using functional neuroimaging. Despite the different modalities used (visual and tactile), all groups of subjects showed a common activation of {BA}37 by words relative to non-word letter-strings. These findings agree with the proposal that {BA}37 is an association area that integrates converging inputs from many regions10.

	abstract = {It is still a popular view that primary sensory cortices are unimodal, but recent physiological studies have shown that under certain behavioral conditions primary sensory cortices can also be activated by multiple other modalities. Here, we investigate the anatomical substrate, which may underlie multisensory processes at the level of the primary auditory cortex (field {AI}), and which may, in turn, enable {AI} to influence other sensory systems. We approached this issue by means of the axonal transport of the sensitive bidirectional neuronal tracer fluorescein-labeled dextran which was injected into {AI} of Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Of the total number of retrogradely labeled cell bodies (i.e. cells of origin of direct projections to {AI}) found in non-auditory sensory and multisensory brain areas, approximately 40\\% were in cortical areas and 60\\% in subcortical structures. Of the cell bodies in the cortical areas about 82\\% were located in multisensory cortex, viz., the dorsoposterior and ventroposterior, posterior parietal cortex, the claustrum, and the endopiriform nucleus, 10\\% were located in the primary somatosensory cortex (hindlimb and trunk region), and 8\\% in secondary visual cortex. The cortical regions with retrogradely labeled cells also contained anterogradely labeled axons and their terminations, i.e. they are also target areas of direct projections from {AI}. In addition, the primary olfactory cortex was identified as a target area of projections from {AI}. The laminar pattern of corticocortical connections suggests that {AI} receives primarily cortical feedback-type inputs and projects in a feedforward manner to its target areas. Of the labeled cell bodies in the subcortical structures, approximately 90\\% were located in multisensory thalamic, 4\\% in visual thalamic, and 6\\% in multisensory lower brainstem structures. At subcortical levels, we observed a similar correspondence of retrogradely labeled cells and anterogradely labeled axons and terminals in visual (posterior limitans thalamic nucleus) and multisensory thalamic nuclei (dorsal and medial division of the medial geniculate body, suprageniculate nucleus, posterior thalamic cell group, zona incerta), and in the multisensory nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus. Retrograde, but not anterograde, labeling was found in the multisensory pontine reticular formation, particularly in the reticulotegmental nucleus of the pons. Conversely, anterograde, but no retrograde, labeling was found in the visual laterodorsal and lateroposterior thalamic nuclei, in the multisensory peripeduncular, posterior intralaminar, and reticular thalamic nuclei, as well as in the multisensory superior and pericentral inferior colliculi (including cuneiform and sagulum nucleus), pontine nuclei, and periaqueductal gray. Our study supports the notion that {AI} is not merely involved in the analysis of auditory stimulus properties but also in processing of other sensory and multisensory information. Since {AI} is directly connected to other primary sensory cortices (viz. the somatosensory and olfactory ones) multisensory information is probably also processed in these cortices. This suggests more generally, that primary sensory cortices may not be unimodal.},

We formulate a generative model of the fluorescence image, incorporating spike times and a spatially smooth neuropil signal, and solve the inference and learning problems using a fast algorithm. This implementation scales linearly with the number of recorded cells, and the complete pipeline runs in approximately one hour for typical two-hour long recordings, on commodity {GPUs}. Furthermore, this method recovers twice as many cells as a previous standard method. This allowed us to routinely record and detect {\textasciitilde}10,000 cells simultaneously from the visual cortex of awake mice using standard two-photon resonant-scanning microscopes.

Here we develop non-invasive fluorescence-based polysomnography for zebrafish, and show—using unbiased, brain-wide activity recording coupled with assessment of eye movement, muscle dynamics and heart rate—that there are at least two major sleep signatures in zebrafish. These signatures, which we term slow bursting sleep and propagating wave sleep, share commonalities with those of slow-wave sleep and paradoxical or rapid eye movement sleep, respectively. Further, we find that melanin-concentrating hormone signalling (which is involved in mammalian sleep) also regulates propagating wave sleep signatures and the overall amount of sleep in zebrafish, probably via activation of ependymal cells. These observations suggest that common neural signatures of sleep may have emerged in the vertebrate brain over 450 million years ago.},

To investigate how these inputs determine locomotor kinematics, we used whole-field visual motion to drive zebrafish to swim at different speeds. Larvae match the stimulus speed by utilizing more locomotor events, or modifying kinematic parameters such as the duration and speed of swimming bouts, the tail-beat frequency, and the choice of gait. We used laser ablations, electrical stimulation, and activity recordings in descending neurons of the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus ({nMLF}) to dissect their contribution to controlling forward movement. We found that the activity of single identified neurons within the {nMLF} is correlated with locomotor kinematics, and modulates both the duration and oscillation frequency of tail movements. By identifying the contribution of individual supraspinal circuit elements to locomotion kinematics, we build a better understanding of how the brain controls movement.},

High-resolution {fMRI} has shown laminar differences in cerebral blood flow ({CBF}), volume ({CBV}) and neurovascular coupling. Features and processes that were previously lumped into a single voxel become spatially distinct at high resolution. These features can be vascular compartments such as veins, arteries, and capillaries, or cortical layers and columns, which can have differences in metabolism. Mesoscopic models of the blood oxygenation level dependent ({BOLD}) response therefore need to be expanded, for instance, to incorporate laminar differences in the coupling between neural activity, metabolism and the hemodynamic response. Here we discuss biological and methodological factors that affect the modeling and interpretation of high-resolution {fMRI} data. We also illustrate with examples from neuropharmacology and the negative {BOLD} response how combining {BOLD} with {CBF}- and {CBV}-based {fMRI} methods can provide additional information about neurovascular coupling, and can aid modeling and interpretation of high-resolution {fMRI}.},

The two main types of such cells in zebrafish—Rohon-Beard and trigeminal neurons—have served as models for neural development [–], but little is known about how they encode tactile stimuli. The hindbrain networks that transduce somatosensory stimuli into a motor output encode information by using very few spikes in a small number of cells [], but it is unclear whether activity in the primary receptor neurons is similarly efficient. To address this question, we manipulated the activity of zebrafish neurons with the light-activated cation channel, Channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2) [, ]. We found that photoactivation of {ChR}2 in genetically defined populations of somatosensory neurons triggered escape behaviors in 24-hr-old zebrafish. Electrophysiological recordings from {ChR}2-positive trigeminal neurons in intact fish revealed that these cells have extremely low rates of spontaneous activity and can be induced to fire by brief pulses of blue light. Using this technique, we find that even a single action potential in a single sensory neuron was at times sufficient to evoke an escape behavior. These results establish {ChR}2 as a powerful tool for the manipulation of neural activity in zebrafish and reveal a degree of efficiency in coding that has not been found in primary sensory neurons.},

In zebrafish, the hindbrain segments contain serially repeated classes of individually identifiable neurons. We took advantage of the transparency of larval zebrafish and used confocal calcium imaging in the intact fish to study the activity of one set of individually identified, serially homologous reticulospinal cells (the Mauthner cell, {MiD}2cm, and {MiD}3cm) during behavior. Behavioral studies predicted that differential activity in this set of serially homologous neurons might serve to control the directionality of the escape behavior that fish use to avoid predators. We found that the serially homologous cells are indeed activated during escapes and that the combination of cells activated depends upon the location of the sensory stimulus used to elicit the escape. The patterns of activation we observed were exactly those predicted by behavioral studies. The data suggest that duplication of ancestral hindbrain segments, and subsequent functional diversification, resulted in sets of related neurons whose activity patterns create behavioral variability.},

	abstract = {Zebrafish escape behaviors, which typically consist of a C bend, a counter-turn, and a bout of rapid swimming, are initiated by firing of the Mauthner cell and two segmental homologs. However, after laser-ablation of the Mauthner cell and its homologs, escape-like behaviors still occur, albeit at a much longer latency. This might suggest that additional neurons contribute to this behavior. We therefore recorded the activity of other descending neurons in the brain stem using confocal imaging of cells retrogradely labeled with fluorescent calcium indicators. A large majority of identified descending neurons present in the larval zebrafish, including both ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting reticulospinal neurons, as well as neurons from the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, showed short-latency calcium responses after gentle taps to the head of the larva—a stimulus that reliably evokes an escape behavior. Previous studies had associated such in vivo calcium responses with the firing of action potentials, and because all responding cells have axons projecting into to spinal cord, this suggests that these cells are relaying escape-related information to spinal cord. Other identified neurons failed to show consistent calcium responses to escape-eliciting stimuli. In conjunction with previous lesion studies, these results indicate that the neural control systems for turning and swimming behaviors are widely distributed in the larval zebrafish brain stem. The degree of robustness or redundancy of this system has implications for the descending control of vertebrate locomotion.},

Zebrafish larvae display a startle response when exposed to tactile, acoustic, or visual stimuli and will avoid dark areas, moving objects, conspecifics, and open spaces. Emotional states such as fear and anxiety might be induced when larvae are exposed to stimuli that they would normally escape from or avoid. Although these emotional states probably differ between species and change during development, much can be learned about human fear and anxiety using zebrafish as a model system. The molecular mechanisms of fear and anxiety are highly conserved in vertebrates and are present during early zebrafish development. Larvae during the first week of development display elevated cortisol levels in response to stress and are sensitive to the same anxiolytics that are used for the management of anxiety in humans. Zebrafish larvae are well suited for high-throughput analyses of behavior, and automated systems have been developed for imaging and analyzing the behavior of zebrafish larvae in multiwell plates. These high-throughput analyses will not only provide a wealth of information on the genes and environmental factors that influence escape and avoidance behaviors and the emotional states that might accompany them but will also facilitate the discovery of novel pharmaceuticals that could be used in the management of anxiety disorders in humans.},

It requires the concurrent development of minimal behavioral and neural circuit models that can quantitatively capture basic sensorimotor operations.

Using a virtual reality assay, we first characterize how motor and visual stimulation sequences govern the selection of discrete swim-bout events that subserve the fish navigation in the presence of a distant light source. These mechanisms are combined into a comprehensive Markov-chain model of navigation that quantitatively predicts the stationary distribution of the fish’s body orientation under any given illumination profile. We then map this behavioral description onto a neuronal model of the {ARTR}, a small neural circuit involved in the orientation-selection of swim bouts. We demonstrate that this visually-biased decision-making circuit can capture the statistics of both spontaneous and contrast-driven navigation.},

Fluorescence microendoscopy is a minimally invasive fiber modality that provides cellular resolution in deep brain areas. Diffuse optical tomography is a non-invasive modality that uses assemblies of fiber optic emitters and detectors on the cranium for volumetric imaging of brain activation. Optical coherence tomography is a sensitive interferometric imaging technique that can be implemented in a variety of fiber based formats and that might allow intrinsic optical detection of brain activity at a high resolution. Miniaturized fiber optic microscopy permits cellular level imaging in the brains of behaving animals. Together, these modalities will enable new uses of imaging in the intact nervous system for both research and clinical applications.},

While purely numerical approaches are useful, there is a need for a simpler analytical formalism that provides physical insight and can be directly used in the design of {PCFs} with low bend loss. We show theoretically and experimentally that a wavelength-dependent critical bend radius exists below which the bend loss reaches a maximum, and that this can be calculated from the structural parameters of a fiber using a simple analytical formula. This allows straightforward design of single-ring {PCFs} that are bend-insensitive for specified ranges of bend radius and wavelength. It also can be used to derive an expression for the bend radius that yields optimal higher-order mode suppression for a given fiber structure.},

Here we describe {cScope}, a head-mounted widefield macroscope developed to image large-scale cortical dynamics in rats during natural behavior. {cScope} provides a 7.8 × 4 mm field of view and dual illumination paths for both fluorescence and hemodynamic correction and can be fabricated at low cost using readily attainable components. We also report the development of Thy-1 transgenic rat strains with widespread neuronal expression of the calcium indicator {GCaMP}6f. We combined these two technologies to image large-scale calcium dynamics in the dorsal neocortex during a visual evidence accumulation task. Quantitative analysis of task-related dynamics revealed multiple regions having neural signals that encode behavioral choice and sensory evidence. Our results provide a new transgenic resource for calcium imaging in rats and extend the domain of head-mounted microscopes to larger-scale cortical dynamics.

Combining these systems with technologies for cellular resolution functional imaging would provide a powerful approach to study neural dynamics during behavior. Here we describe an integrated two-photon microscope and behavioral apparatus that allows cellular resolution functional imaging of cortical regions during epochs of voluntary head restraint. Rats were trained to initiate periods of restraint up to 8 s in duration, which provided the mechanical stability necessary for in vivo imaging while allowing free movement between behavioral trials. A mechanical registration system repositioned the head to within a few microns, allowing the same neuronal populations to be imaged on each trial. In proof-of-principle experiments, calcium-dependent fluorescence transients were recorded from {GCaMP}-labeled cortical neurons. In contrast to previous methods for head restraint, this system can be incorporated into high-throughput operant conditioning systems.},

	abstract = {The posterior parietal cortex ({PPC}) participates in a manifold of cognitive functions, including visual attention, working memory, spatial processing and movement planning. Given the vast interconnectivity of {PPC} with sensory and motor areas, it is not surprising that neuronal recordings show that {PPC} often encodes mixtures of spatial information as well as the movements required to reach a goal. Recent work sought to discern the relative strength of spatial versus motor signaling in {PPC} by recording single unit activity in {PPC} of freely behaving rats during selective changes in either the spatial layout of the local environment or in the pattern of locomotor behaviors executed during navigational tasks. The results revealed unequivocally a predominant sensitivity of {PPC} neurons to locomotor action structure, with subsets of cells even encoding upcoming movements more than 1 second in advance. In light of these and other recent findings in the field, I propose that one of the key contributions of {PPC} to navigation is the synthesis of goal-directed behavioral sequences, and that the rodent {PPC} may serve as an apt system to investigate cellular mechanisms for spatial motor planning as traditionally studied in humans and monkeys.},

Neural activity in rodents has been studied on virtual 1D tracks. However, 2D navigation imposes additional requirements, such as the processing of head direction and environment boundaries, and it is unknown whether the neural circuits underlying 2D representations can be sufficiently engaged in {VR}. We implemented a {VR} setup for rats, including software and large-scale electrophysiology, that supports 2D navigation by allowing rotation and walking in any direction. The entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, including place, head direction, and grid cells, showed 2D activity patterns similar to those in the real world. Furthermore, border cells were observed, and hippocampal remapping was driven by environment shape, suggesting functional processing of virtual boundaries. These results illustrate that 2D spatial representations can be engaged by visual and rotational vestibular stimuli alone and suggest a novel {VR} tool for studying rat navigation.},
